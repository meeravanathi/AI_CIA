### ALGORITHMS
## British Museum Search
The British Museum Search algorithm is a graph traversal method designed to find all possible paths between nodes in a graph. It uses either depth-first or breadth-first search strategies to explore the graph systematically, ensuring comprehensive exploration of all routes.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

## Depth-First Search (DFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, making it useful for tasks like pathfinding and topological sorting.

## Hill Climbing
Hill Climbing is a local search algorithm that continuously moves towards the direction of increasing elevation or value to find the peak or optimal solution. It is often used in optimization problems but can get stuck in local maxima.

## Beam Search
Beam Search is an optimization of the breadth-first search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising nodes within a limited set (the "beam"). It maintains a fixed number of best candidates at each level, reducing memory consumption while sacrificing completeness.

## Oracle Search
Oracle Search is a search algorithm that utilizes an "oracle" or an external knowledge source to guide the search process. The oracle provides insights or recommendations about which paths to explore, enabling the algorithm to focus on more promising options and improve efficiency in finding solutions, often used in optimization and decision-making problems.

## Oracle Search with Cost Heuristics
Oracle Search with Cost Heuristics is an advanced search algorithm that utilizes an oracle to provide guidance based on cost evaluations. The oracle not only recommends paths to explore but also incorporates cost heuristics to estimate the remaining effort required to reach the goal. This combination enhances the search efficiency by prioritizing paths with lower expected costs, making it particularly effective in optimization problems and decision-making scenarios.

## Branch and Bound
Branch and Bound is an optimization algorithm used for solving combinatorial and discrete optimization problems. It systematically explores branches of a tree by dividing the problem into smaller subproblems (branching) and calculating bounds on the best possible solution in each subproblem to eliminate those that cannot yield a better solution than the current best (bounding). This method is effective for finding optimal solutions while minimizing the search space.

## Branch and Bound with Extended List
Branch and Bound with Extended List is an optimization technique that enhances the standard Branch and Bound algorithm by maintaining an extended list of candidate solutions to efficiently explore and prune the search space, ensuring the optimal solution is found while reducing unnecessary computations.

## A*
A* is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm that combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and a heuristic approach, efficiently finding the shortest path by minimizing the total estimated cost from the start node to the goal.

## AO*
AO* is a search algorithm used for solving problems with AND/OR graph structures, focusing on minimizing the total cost while exploring paths that involve both AND and OR nodes, effectively managing uncertainty in branching decisions.

### Best First Search
Best First Search is a heuristic search algorithm that expands the most promising nodes first based on a cost function, often evaluating nodes based on estimated cost to reach the goal. It prioritizes nodes in a priority queue, allowing efficient exploration of the search space.
